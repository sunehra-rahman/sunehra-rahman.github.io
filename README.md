### AOS C111/204 final project: Supervised Regression

For this project, I train a machine learning model using the liver disorder dataset from the UC Irvine ML Repository to predict alcohol consumption that may lead to liver disorders.

**Code**

I used [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Enhj0GuqeWmsO9ZAx_DTunrv4-5qREpK?usp=sharing) to code my model.

**Project Report**

The report for my findings is on project.md
